This code challenge has three types of projects;
1. Student Grade Generator.
2. Speed detector.
3. Net salary calculator.

Student Grade Generator.
This program prompts the user to input student marks, which should be between 0 and 100. It then assigns the corresponding grades as follows:

A: 80 and above
B: 60 to 79
C: 49 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: less than 40
The program then outputs the correct grade based on the input provided.


Speed Detector.
This program takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "OK". However, if the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the program assigns one demerit point for every 5 km/h above the speed limit. It then prints the total number of demerit points accumulated.

For instance, if the speed is 80 km/h, it would print: "Points: 2". If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints: "License suspended".

This program serves as a tool to track demerit points for speeding violations and provides warnings when the driver's license is at risk of suspension. 

 


Net Salary Calculator.
This program is designed to calculate an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It computes various deductions such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) deductions, and National Social Security Fund (NSSF) deductions, along with gross salary and net salary.

It utilizes tax rates provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and NHIF/NSSF values from the official websites:

KRA Tax Rates
NHIF and NSSF Rates
This program provides a convenient tool for individuals to estimate their take-home pay after deductions and benefits.



Installation.
You use git clone on your computer's terminal to download the documents in the Github to the local machine.


Installation Requirements.
Git: Ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download and install Git from the official website: Git Downloads.
GitHub Account: You should have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free on the GitHub website.


Installation Instruction.
Find the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository page that you want to clone.

Get the Clone URL: Click on the "Code" button, and then copy the URL provided. It will look something like this: https://github.com/username/repository.git.

Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.

Clone the Repository: Once you're in the desired directory, use the git clone command followed by the URL you copied earlier. For example:


                      git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Verify: Once the cloning process is complete, you should see the repository files in the directory you specified.

That's it! You've successfully cloned a project from GitHub. Now you can navigate into the cloned directory and start working with the project files.
